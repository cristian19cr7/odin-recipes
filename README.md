# odin-recipes
This is a the first project in the Odin project course. The project is a basic recipe webpage displaying 3 recipes with ingredients and directions. All recipes and infomation was taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/ . This webpage showcases my basic knowledge of HTML tags and git commands.
