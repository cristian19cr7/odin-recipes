    <p>These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time! They cook in a crockpot until tender, then are covered with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs. Perfect for during the week as the slow cooker does most of the work!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Season ribs with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour 1/2 cup water into the slow cooker, then add ribs. Scatter onion and garlic over top. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or High for 4 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the ribs are almost finished, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
